# Team Profile Generator

## Description
I was assigned to create an application that would dynamically create an html file containing inputed information. Specifically, for a manager's team that would collect and display the desired info. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out the logic of chaining the inquirer prompts and the ".then". Another challenge was making sure that I didnt lose any data, and that everything flowed through the parameters as intended.

## Notes
At an early stage, I intended to use the node Chalk but as another things required attention I never set it up. Hopefully one day soon I can go back and incorporate it.
